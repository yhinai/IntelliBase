## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Run Streamlit UI with System Testing
```bash
streamlit run streamlit_ui.py
```
- Navigate to "🧪 System Test" tab
- Click "🧪 Run System Test" to execute comprehensive tests
- View interactive plotly visualizations in the UI

### 2. Run Standalone System Test
```bash
python comprehensive_system_test.py
```
- Generates test results in `test_results/` directory
- Creates interactive HTML dashboards
- Outputs performance metrics and recommendations

### 3. Run Integration Tests
```bash
python test_integration.py
```
- Verifies all components are properly integrated
- Tests imports and basic functionality
- Validates file structure and dependencies
